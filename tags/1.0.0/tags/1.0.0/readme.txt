**NOTE:** Authorship of this plugin has just been transferred to [webdevmattcrom](http://profiles.wordpress.org/webdevmattcrom). It will be updated soon to work with the latest version of WordPress. If you have specific feature requests, add them in the Support form and I'll do my best to incorporate them.

In the meantime, checkout [ZOOM!](http://wordpress.org/plugins/foogallery-zoom-template), which is a template for [FooGallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/foogallery) which gives you this same (or similar) feature.
